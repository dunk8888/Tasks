Tasks
=====
A simple task library for Arduino, using setjmp/longjmp inspired by [LWP](https://github.com/jscrane/lwp).

Example
-------
    
    #include <Tasks.h>

    Semaphore off, on;

    void run() {
        for (;;) {
            on.wait();
            digitalWrite(0, LOW);
            delay(1000);
        	off.signal();
        }
    }

    Task<128> task(run);
    
    void setup() {
        Tasks::init();
        off.begin(1);
        on.begin(0);
        task.begin();
        pinMode(0, OUTPUT);
    }

    void loop() {
        off.wait();
        digitalWrite(0, HIGH);
        delay(1000);
        on.signal();
    }

Remarks
-------
* There are two tasks, one explicitly created, and the other implicit (i.e., 
the "main task").
* Tasks are of equal priority and run until completion, i.e., until they
run out of things to do; by blocking on a semaphore or explicitly yielding
the processor.
* In the example, two tasks coordinate turning an LED off and on using two semaphores.
